# Job-Posting-Classification-

This Streamlit app scrapes job listings from [Karkidi.com](https://www.karkidi.com), preprocesses and clusters them using unsupervised learning (KMeans), and recommends jobs to users based on their input skills or interests.

 Features

-  Web scraping from Karkidi.com
-  Text preprocessing (Skills + Summary)
-  TF-IDF vectorization
-  Clustering using KMeans
-  Streamlit-based interactive web app
-  Simple job recommender by user input

 Installation & Run Locally

 It Works

### 1. Scraping (`scrape_karkidi_jobs`)

* Scrapes job titles, companies, locations, summaries, and skills

### 2. Preprocessing

* Merges summary + skills into a single text feature

### 3. Clustering

* Vectorizes text with `TfidfVectorizer`
* Clusters job posts using `KMeans` into predefined clusters
* Saves model and vectorizer with `joblib`

### 4. Streamlit App

* User enters their interests/skills
* App predicts the most relevant job cluster
* Shows jobs from that cluster
